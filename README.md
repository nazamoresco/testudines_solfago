# Testudines Solfago

A Flutter and Flame game.

## Description:

In Testudines Solfago, players play as a Testudines Solfago, a mythical sun-eating turtle. 
This game is a survival, where players must keep a balance of the turtles temperature by eating suns and avoiding meteors.

## How to Play

* Controls 
  * Move: Arrow keys or WASD
  * Restart Game: Spacebar
* Objective: Eat 20 suns.

## Theme

The theme, 'Hot and Cold,' immediately brought to mind the concept of temperature, specifically in relation to living organisms and their need for homeostasis. 
Reptiles face a unique challenge, being unable to internally regulate their temperature. 
This sparked the idea of a cosmic turtle that maintains its body heat by consuming suns - a delicate balance between overheating and becoming too cold.

In the game, this concept is embodied by a thermostat that displays the temperature of the turtle. 
Consuming suns raises its temperature, while avoiding them causes a drop. 
A red overlay accompanied by the sound of burning indicates overheating.
A blue overlay with the sound of a cold wind signifies a drop in temperature.

## Limitation

I picked the *multiple endings* limitation, these are the endings:
1. Super hot: You ate too many suns, you become one yourself.
2. Super cold: Your temperature drop too low, you die of hypothermia.
3. Meteor Crash: Pierced by a meteor, you die.
4. Spawining eggs: You ate 20 suns and are ready to spawn your eggs. You won.

## Testing

I have added easy access to ending, because some of them can be tricky to obtain:
* F9: Spawning eggs ending
* F8: Too hot ending
* F7: Too cold ending
